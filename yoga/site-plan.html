    <h2>Yoga Definition:</h2>
    <p>Yoga is an ancient practice focused on breathing and physical exercises (asanas) to improve mental
      and physical well-being. It aligns the body and mind, addressing health issues, and the term "yoga,"
      from Sanskrit, signifies the union of mind and body through breath.
    </p>
    <p>Hatha yoga is characterized by slower-paced classes where poses are held for multiple breaths. It
      highlights the connection between physical postures and breathing, with the goal of opening energy
      channels, especially in the spine, to promote the smooth flow of energy. It's worth noting that
      well-known yoga schools like Vinyasa, Ashtanga, Bikram, and Iyengar all originate from Hatha yoga.
    </p>
    <p>Yin yoga focuses on extended, seated, or lying poses, focusing on flexibility, connective tissues,
      and promoting balance, stress relief, and improved flexibility. It offers a unique approach to joint
      health compared to active stretching.</p>
    <p>Vinyasa, also known as "Baptiste Yoga," "Prana Flow," or "Power Yoga," emphasizes the integration of
      breath with smooth transitions between poses while following a consistent sequence in classes that
      enhances stamina.</p>
    <p>Ashtanga yoga is an intensive practice featuring structured sequences performed in a precise order.
      It can be instructed in a guided class or a self-paced format, requiring students to commit the
      sequence and timing to memory. Ashtanga is known for its rigorous nature, discipline, and its focus
      on generating heat for detoxification and core strengthening.</p>

    <p>There are exixts a style of yoga that is practice inside a heated room. This kind of style can be
      any yoga type like Yin or Vinyasa, but practiced in a hot room.</p>

    <h4>Yoga history</h4>
    <p>Yoga has its origins in northern India more than 5,000 years ago and is documented in the ancient
      sacred texts of the Rig Veda, which is part of the four Vedas written in Sanskrit. Rishis, or sages,
      further developed and recorded yoga practices in the Upanishads. Although yoga made its way from
      Asia, primarily India, to Europe and the United States in the mid-1800s, it truly gained substantial
      popularity during the 1960s and '70s.</p>    
    <p>Hatha Yoga</p>

      activation, support for detoxification, increased strength, stamina, and blood circulation, better
      digestion, and more. Furthermore, yoga is versatile in its ability to address symptoms related to
