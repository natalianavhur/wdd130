                <p>Hatha yoga is characterized by slower-paced classes where poses are held for multiple breaths. It
                    highlights the connection between physical postures and breathing, with the goal of opening energy
                    channels, especially in the spine, to promote the smooth flow of energy. It's worth noting that
                    well-known yoga schools like Vinyasa, Ashtanga, Bikram, and Iyengar all originate from Hatha yoga.

                <p>Yin yoga focuses on extended, seated, or lying poses, focusing on flexibility, connective tissues,
                    and promoting balance, stress relief, and improved flexibility. It offers a unique approach to joint
                    health compared to active stretching.</p>

                <p>Vinyasa, also known as "Baptiste Yoga," "Prana Flow," or "Power Yoga," emphasizes the integration of
                    breath with smooth transitions between poses while following a consistent sequence in classes that
                    enhances stamina.</p>

                <p>Ashtanga yoga is an intensive practice featuring structured sequences performed in a precise order.
                    It can be instructed in a guided class or a self-paced format, requiring students to commit the
                    sequence and timing to memory. Ashtanga is known for its rigorous nature, discipline, and its focus
                    on generating heat for detoxification and core strengthening.</p>
