                    <h2>Yoga Definition</h2>
                    <p>Yoga is an ancient practice focused on breathing and physical exercises (asanas) to improve
                        mental
                        and physical well-being. It aligns the body and mind, addressing health issues, and the term
                        "yoga,"
                        from Sanskrit, signifies the union of mind and body through breath.

                        <p>Hatha Yoga is characterized by slower-paced classes where poses are held for multiple
                            breaths. It
                            highlights the connection between physical postures and breathing, with the goal of opening
                            energy
                            channels, especially in the spine, to promote the smooth flow of energy. It's worth noting
                            that
                            well-known yoga schools like Vinyasa, Ashtanga, Bikram, and Iyengar all originate from Hatha
                            yoga.

                        <p>Yin yoga focuses on extended, seated, or lying poses, focusing on flexibility, connective

                            and promoting balance, stress relief, and improved flexibility. It offers a unique approach

                        <p>Vinyasa, also known as "Baptiste Yoga," "Prana Flow," or "Power Yoga," emphasizes the

                            of
                            breath with smooth transitions between poses while following a consistent sequence in

                        <p>Ashtanga yoga is an intensive practice featuring structured sequences performed in a precise
                            order.
                            It can be instructed in a guided class or a self-paced format, requiring students to commit
                            the
                            sequence and timing to memory. Ashtanga is known for its rigorous nature, discipline, and
                            its
                            focus

                    <p>"There is a yoga style practiced in a heated room that encourages significant sweating and
                        loosening of muscles. This style can include various types, like Yin or Vinyasa, but it's
                        specifically conducted in a hot environment. Due to this intensity, individuals with health
                        issues and pregnant women are advised against practicing this type of yoga."</p>
