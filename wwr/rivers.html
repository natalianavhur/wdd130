                            Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon
                            was given
                            the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the
                            number of
                            folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they
                            never left.

                            Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are
                            also
                            commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which
                            tower over
                            the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.

                            Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest
                            undammed
                            rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder
                            in the
                            early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all
                            summer...but
                            families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer
                            water more.

                            Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the
                            Green river
                            flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful
                            desert scenery,
                            and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to
                            Swaseys Rapid
                            (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic
                            formations,
                            evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.

                            Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on

                            uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.

                            Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make
                            one truly
                            unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater
                            rapids, but
                            with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.

                            CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are
                            technically
                            rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances.
                            However, most
                            people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.

                    <p>Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children over
                        the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their
                        children are all over 8). </p>

                    <p>As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To
                        help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with
                        at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that
                        occur on land.</p>
