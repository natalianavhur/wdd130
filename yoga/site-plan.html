        Yoga Definition
      </h3>
      <p>
        Yoga is an ancient practice focused on breathing and physical exercises (asanas) to improve mental and physical well-being. It aligns the body and mind, addressing health issues, and the term "yoga," from Sanskrit, signifies the union of mind and body through breath.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Yoga History 
      </h3>
      <img src="images/history.jpg" alt="Yoga Statue">
      <p>
        Yoga has its origins in northern India more than 5,000 years ago and is documented in the ancient sacred texts of the Rig Veda, which is part of the four Vedas written in Sanskrit. Rishis, or sages, further developed and recorded yoga practices in the Upanishads. Although yoga made its way from Asia, primarily India, to Europe and the United States in the mid-1800s, it truly gained substantial popularity during the 1960s and '70s.
      </p>
      <h3> Different types of Yoga  </h3>
      <p>
        Several popular yoga schools, such as Vinyasa, Ashtanga, Bikram (hot yoga), and Iyengar, have their roots in Hatha yoga, each offering distinct core principles, teaching styles, methods, and physical advantages. This practice includes postures known as asanas and breath regulation called pranayama, promoting meditative concentration and relaxation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hot yoga, pioneered by Bikram yoga in the 1970s, is practiced in a heated room, with temperatures typically ranging from the high 80s to 105 degrees Fahrenheit, although specific conditions can vary by studio. Practitioners frequently report experiencing various benefits, including improvements in physical and musculoskeletal conditions and mental well-being.
      </p>
      <h3>Hatha Yoga</h3>
      <img src="images/hatha.jpg" alt="Hatha Yoga">
      <p>
        Hatha yoga is characterized by slower-paced classes where poses are held for multiple breaths. It highlights the connection between physical postures and breathing, with the goal of opening energy channels, especially in the spine, to promote the smooth flow of energy. It's worth noting that well-known yoga schools like Vinyasa, Ashtanga, Bikram, and Iyengar all originate from Hatha yoga.
      </p>
      <h3>Yin Yoga</h3>
      <img src="images/yin.jpg" alt="Yin Yoga">
      <p>
        Yin yoga focuses on extended, seated, or lying poses, focusing on flexibility, connective tissues, and promoting balance, stress relief, and improved flexibility. It offers a unique approach to joint health compared to active stretching.
      </p>
      <h3>Vinyasa Yoga</h3>
      <img src="images/vinyasa.jpg" alt="Vinyasa Yoga">
      <p>
        Vinyasa, also known as "Baptiste Yoga," "Prana Flow," or "Power Yoga," emphasizes the integration of breath with smooth transitions between poses while following a consistent sequence in classes that enhances stamina.
      </p>
      <h3>Ashtanga Yoga</h3>
      <img src="images/ashtanga.jpg" alt="Ashtanga Yoga">
      <p>
        Ashtanga yoga is an intensive practice featuring structured sequences performed in a precise order. It can be instructed in a guided class or a self-paced format, requiring students to commit the sequence and timing to memory. Ashtanga is known for its rigorous nature, discipline, and its focus on generating heat for detoxification and core strengthening.
      </p>
      <h3>
