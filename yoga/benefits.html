                    <h4>Yoga history</h4>
                    <p>Yoga, rooted in northern India, dates back over 5,000 years. It migrated from Asia to Europe and
                        the US in the mid-1800s, carried by scholars
                        exploring Eastern philosophies. However, its notable popularity blossomed during the 1960s and
                        1970s in the West, driven by its perceived holistic benefits. This surge in interest propelled
                        yoga into the mainstream, integrating it into modern lifestyles globally. With its rich history
                        and benefits, yoga has transformed into a revered global practice for physical, mental, and
                        spiritual well-being.</p>
